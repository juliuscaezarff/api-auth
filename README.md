# Api Auth

This project is a modern authentication API built with the following technologies:

- **Bun**: An ultra-fast JavaScript/TypeScript runtime used to run the server.
- **Elysia**: A minimal and efficient web framework for building fast and secure APIs.
- **Better-auth**: A complete authentication solution, supporting multiple login methods, session management, and easy integration.
- **Drizzle ORM**: A lightweight and type-safe ORM for PostgreSQL, providing strong typing and efficient migrations.
- **Zod**: A schema validation library to ensure the integrity of data received and sent by the API.
- **BiomeJS**: A toolkit for code formatting, linting, and analysis, promoting code quality and consistency.

The main goal of this project is to provide a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for user authentication, making it easy to integrate with modern applications and promoting best development practices.
